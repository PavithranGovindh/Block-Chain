 Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake
   -consensus mechanisms

1.	Both consensus mechanism requires initial  invesments, for PoW it is in the form of buying components (Creating a powerful nodes to find the nounce to achieve required hash) and for PoS it is in the form of deposit (where he have to initially buy the stakes).

2.	when the transactions are initiated it will stored in the unconfirmed pool of transactions.
PoW – miners selects the transactions from the pool put it in a block, try to find the nounce inorder to achieve the required nounce. This process is known as mining.
PoS -  no mining is involved it is based on minting/forging. Validators validates the transactions and attest it.

3.	PoW is the most popular consensus mechanism but also it comes with a drawback as it requires more electricity power to operate the node than PoS. PoS is more cost efficient when compared to PoW.

4.	51% consensus
In PoW – the hackers have to gain the control over 51% of nodes.(If the majority mining pools comes together, then this 51% consensus is possible. In 2019 , About 52% of Ethereum coins was mined by 2 pools, ethermine and sparkpool )
In PoS – the hackers have to own the 51% stake.

5.	In PoW, the node with more computational power will likely to win the reward, as in PoS the node with higher owning stake will likely to get the chance to validate.

6.	Bitcoin, Ethereum 1.0 works on PoW
whereas Ethereum 2.0 works on PoS.

7.	Most of the blockchain technologies are going with the PoS due to its accessability, scalability.
